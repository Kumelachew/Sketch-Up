# The Odin Project: Javascript/JQuery Project

Features implemented:

1. Create a web page with a 16x16 grid of square divs. The divs were created
dynamically through Jquery.
2. Implemented a hover effect so it changes the color of the square when your mouse passes over it, leaving a (pixelated) trail through your grid like a pen would.
3. Added a button to the top of the screen which will clear the current grid. I also added a new grid buttom that will send the user a popup asking for how many squares per side to make a new grid. Once entered, the new grid will be generated in the same total space as before (e.g. 960px wide).
4. Added a drop down list for the user to be able to pick a color.
